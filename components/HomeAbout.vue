          <p>
            Son of a preacher. Born in a boys' home in Louisiana. Mentored for
            the ministry. Raised by the road.

            Bay Area-based and Bayou-reared Meshach Jackson delivers his soulful
            lyrics with an emotional intensity that can only come from someone
            who was raised on equal parts gospel and grunge.  Meshach draws the
            audience in with his emotionally raw, intimately truthful lyrics and
            impassioned stage presence.

              Having shared the stage with diverse acts such as Switchfoot,
              Damien Rice, Mute Math, and Earth Wind & Fire, Meshach’s original
              work follows in this trend. He draws influence from everything
              from Delta Blues artists of the 1930s and 1940s to Tom Waits and
              Jack White; Bjork to Beck; Radiohead to Bonnie Raitt.
            </p>

            Inspired by the authentic and searching for the heart of American
            music, Meshach’s work is largely influenced by his childhood as the
            son of a southern preacher who ran a boys home for troubled teens;
            becoming an ordained minister himself at the age of 18; leaving the
            ministry to pursue a career as a songwriter at 21; working in the
            tech industry to rebound from the debts of the music business; and
            finally leaving it all again to go back on the road full time.

              From the middle of the night in Little Rock, Arkansas to mornings
              in Fargo, North Dakota; winters in the Southeast, and summers in
              the Pacific Northwest; these journeys have all left their imprint
              on Meshach’s evocative sound. Meshach has traveled the country “by
              any means necessary”; including train, bus, hitchhiking,
              and a trusty Toyota Carolla - developing his sound from the soul
              of New Orleans to the grime of New York City; from the grit of
              Austin to the groove of Los Angeles and beyond. A
              self-proclaimed “nomadic gypsy wanderer”, Meshach spends time
              between his most recent tours in the San Francisco Bay Area.
